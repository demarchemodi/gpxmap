# gpxmap

This Python project presents tracks from gpx files in an HTML map. It uses GpxPy and Folium to load and present the data.

It is a simple study project for me to get more in touch with Python and Git-CLI. In the mean time it motivates me to create new gpx files.
For creating my own gpx files, I use the free app Open GPX Tracker.

This script is inspired by Ardit Sulce's course https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course and 
Patrick's blogpost https://towardsdatascience.com/build-interactive-gps-activity-maps-from-gpx-files-using-folium-cf9eebba1fe7

I guess this project is work in progress, however, feel free to use it.

Best regards,
Demarchemodi
